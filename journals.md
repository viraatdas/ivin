InferentIO notes: pitch it as real estate when I was talking to kawin

# 2023-12-27

When I observe my mother sometimes, I get absolutely confused as to what is happening in her mind. She is so disconnected sometimes when she is talking and just absolutely tapped out. Sometimes watching her interact can be aggravating where she is so lost… and not 100% paying attention.

For work, it seems like she is able to pay more or less complete attention. It always feels like she needs to be shook. I don’t know if there is something wrong with her or if it’s just some sort of stress or if there is some other tertiary issue. 

But it’s interesting how she is able to get things done and still be able to do all of it.

This is an overdue idea but wanted to jot it down 

**Live for the kid inside of you**

The hypothesis here is that growing you were pure intentions of things you really wanted to do. 

You most likely had an idea of impact and you felt sympathy. 

Somewhere along the clogs of capitalism your dreams faded and you decided that becoming an accountant or something secure was the way to go. 

While every practical needs to be met, this blog cannot reduce your situation to a happy go lucky do whatever.

What I do want to point out though is a modality of thinking to appease to your youngest base self is the most noble and fulfilling way of living life.

I’m not saying switching careers every 2 second like your younger self would be like, but the genuine passion and joy that kids got doing things they wanted to do

**My Open Letter to Nikita**

To Ms. Aggarwal,

A chance, perhaps not so chance, encounter approximately 3 years set into motion a series of subsequent encounters where we have gotten to each other and deepen our affection for each other. 

Within these 3 years, we have for sure changed in some ways but in many have been very much the same. We have had a few forks in the road that we have in some way bridged on but some that are still not resolved. This letter is to address those. I feel like not resolving them is ignoring them.

**My L-Word (but not actually) Types Ka Poem**

Knife to my neck, piercing my skin 

With blood dripping

Yet it’s you I wish to see 

I want to go to lengths to be with you 

And just hold your hands 

And pull you close to me

My breath grows thin

Lost in your being 

Wanting, nay, needing more

I ask myself why

Not agonizing my ignorance

My eyes reflecting the fires of my heart

I grasp the empty air 

And wonder why you aren’t there

The cruel hands of Mistress Fate

### Maama (mom’s brother)

I creek open the door 

To try and surprise you 

But ah - plan thwarted 

“Maama is here!” 

After a hearty big ole hug 

I bust out what I know will be her new favorite gift 

And I sat down and we played 

For what must've been an hour 

Her mom comes in 

Startling me, as it always did 

We greet our hellos

And get to chatting 

The dad comes out and also greets me 

While we go over the topics of the day 

I discuss the latest development of my life

And the some technical details of what I was doing

I include her 

And explain things to her

And, like her mom, there was the insane number of questions

She was interested in anything and everything - and I could throw it really all at her 

Her bedtime 

The dad and mom sit talking 

And I thought to myself why am I doing this 

What I am doing here

I sit across the father and wonder if he is fine with me 

And wonder what the mother is truly thinking

Is she fine? She probably is.

Am I fine? 

Of course, I nudge myself to attention 

This is the life I chose, it is what is more noble 

Some journeys are better traveled alone 

At least that's how I convinced myself

Why do I battle my natural desires? 

Of course, I said, I must be in control or I am nothing 

I continue to laugh and put up a facade that even manages to fool me

Something I have learned since her birth 

I look towards her room 

Wondering about who I am 

What my actions mean 

And why did I belligerently choose *this* 

I need to grow, is what I remembered I said 

And it's only through pain and loss that I can truly do that 

“Do you want some more rice” 

I snap out of my daze 

“No thanks! I should get going! Hope she loves her gift. Let's be honest, her favorite maama got it for her so of course she would” 

As I rushed outside, holding a tear

*Alone in a Relationship*

MC sat on his desk, his gazed fixed on the blinking cursor on his laptop screen on a text terminal. He wasn’t able to code. His father had been diagnosed with an illness that wasn’t life threatening but required him to leave. His mom had called him, with a tremor in the voice that he immediately quelled. If MC had confidence things would be fine, his mom seem to did.. He immediately booked a flight for the same day. He wasn’t surprised… he expected it. He always did. MC always thought of worst cases, but you wouldn’t think that. He always seem light-hearted and the whole world was fine… but his world was crumbling. 

As soon as he booked his flight, he took a deep breath. It was 1:03 AM on the clock. He wasn’t sure what to do. So he did what he did best… started working. But he couldn’t muster to write a single line of code. His flight wasn’t for 6 hours and he didn’t know what to do. 

He stared and he stared at the screen. He didn’t know what to do. His world was crumbling. He had so much to do. So little time. People depended on him. “Buddha was right,” a thought flashed in his bed, “severing ties from everyone was the only path of salvation.”  But that didn’t quite make sense. He wasn’t.. englightenment. His brain was a mush. Thinking about random things. 

He thought about his goals. He was in the midst of starting something that he felt would have larger implications. He was just feeling ready to take the financial risk when his dad was diagnosed with something. Everyone hoped that the tumor was benign. It seemed liek it was benign. But MC knew that worst cases can happen. He was mentally ready. And he carried this burden. Obviously, he would never share this thought with anyone because what he realized was that people need strength in times of distress. That’s how people felt fine. Crumbling down and crying wasn’t the solution. Holding a smile, processing understand what was happening, having a steady head, and understanding what to be said and actions and things. 

After hearing his mom called him, and he hung up and his pause. He just wanted to curl up into a ball and cry. In this moment he also had a though about how he felt disassociated with his girlfriend. He was afraid to tell her how he felt because… well he wasn’t sure. He didn’t know how we felt - he just knew what had to be done. But also part of it was that… maybe he felt what would his girlfriend do. He didn’t want to emotionally burden her. 

At the same time he felt that there wasn’t an intellectual force in her that.. perhaps he might’ve lacked. He was confused what he wanted in a relationship. He wasn’t sure what he felt and he noticed his girlfriend sleeping on a bed and feeling a distinct emotion of just feeling… alone.

In all of his world crumbling, he didn’t find the comfort that he felt he offered to other - the reliance - the ability to simply be able to rely on him. His girlfriend was a nice kindred spirit. She was perfect in paper… but he felt that she lacked a general investment or perhaps understtanding into his motives and why he was the way he was. The general tenacity he had was something he lacked. And he felt that he lacks 

His mind was wandering he realized… he was thinking about everything at once… this always happened… He didn’t seek out people even though he had friends and family… he submitted himself to himself and his thoughts… and he really thought. 

He didn’t trust anyone or anything in his world to really understand the complexity of what he felt… and as he thought this he realized the arrogance in that… and he acknowledged it. He perhaps recognized that it was his naivety and all of what he was thinking was naivety.

Maybe his mom was right. When he had mentioned this to her, she mentioned, “do you not think it’s just enough to like the person”. The three years that he dated her, he wasn’t able to say the coveted three word sentence, “I love you.” He didn’t feel like he felt that.. and he wondered about that… was it because.

His work.. his thoughts jumped again. He can’t be wasting time. He had to get this out… and somehow along the way he again lost himself and fell into it. 

MC would continue to feel this… and how even with people around him, he felt alone… and he thought… perhaps thats what his life is… loneliness… 

Maybe the Buddha was right.

- How to build a system/startup/growth factor that incentivizes incentives?
    - for example, companies don’t build factories in places where people won’t move but how do you create that for people? Go to a city and build infrastructure that’ll pull people to that place, pull talented people, and allow for jobs to move from denser areas to some of these more scarce areas?

Business proposal:

- How do I build a startup that takes federal, state, and city money and invests in cities.  Or maybe takes an equity from. thecity. ithelps builds the infrastructure and growht incentives. And then it takes money in form of taxes and such.

Another Nikita journal. This is getting frustrating. 

I won’t even bother reading my previous journal. I think I’ll just make me feel that nothing has changed.

In the last week, I don’t think she has educated herself on my startup. She mentioned my paper - but I doubt she’ll read it anytime soon. 

In fact, she hasn’t bothered even reading it and assumed that it was complex. 

i find that she is rarely interested in talking to me. Like even her gut reactions is getting distracted. It started out  as a brb call and then midway into the call she said she wanted to play FTW and then she wanted to sing and then I feel like she is making it on me to want to talk to her. 

I just… sigh… at this point I feel like these are things. that I don’t want in a relationship. 

I think I want to breakup just because my intellectural needs aren’t getting fulfilled and I don’t think will. 

# 2023-10-23

It’s becoming a little bit more apparent that Nikita and I are not as compatible and the path for that seems like it’s diminishing.

I find her sensitivity and proneness to crying something that will limit quick conversation. 

I find myself getting frustrated whenever we talk sometimes about subjects that seems trivial. 

I don’t feel myself learning talking to her. I don’t think that part will happen soon. 

It seems that she wants me to be proud that she is going through an existential crisis, but obviously we know that is not even 30% of the journey. It takes a lot more. 

I don’t feel inspired talking to her. She is just the comfortable face of someone sweet that I enjoy talking to most of the times.

I find myself increasingly concerned with the overhead Nikita is putting on me as before. This is just something of a matter of 2 days ago, so I want to dispel this burden.

Few events concern me:

1. When I was at the hospital, the concern was for some silly how I didn’t mention it to her rather than the fact I was hospitalized
2. I feel like there isn’t a concern about how I am feeling in life. Maybe the direct events concern but there isn’t an interest in going to the depth of things… and I think that bothers me. I take it that a friend should be that way, but someone I’m dating should try to do the deep-end plunge with me right?

Corollarily, I’m able to sense the gap in our maturity. I don’t think she thinks about things to the depth at which I do; she is largely disconnected from interesting contemporary subjects, so it doesn’t seem like I’ll be able to discuss modern relevant topics with her; reading books might not be something that she’ll be into. I believe I’ll be subjected to a lifetime of this.

Along the same lines, she seems to want someone who will be patient with her and coddle her. I feel I have largely lost the capacity to be this person… and if I haven’t I don’t. I feel a lot of rage inside of me regarding my current situation and what I need to do and I try my best to keep that inside of me and bottle that up or express that in a healthy way. I can’t or really don’t want to be that person. 

The fact that she is citing issues of me affecting her mental health: now in good faith I can’t let something like that be on me. 

Effectively speaking, I think being honest and truthful is important here. I’m dating her for her potential which is not the best way of dating. As harsh as it might be, I’ll convey this to her later in the day.

I feel lost, perhaps slightly melancholic.

Wondering what do I need to do.

Do I need to move to Canada for this,

I feel like no one quite believes in me, and I’m stuck in a wallow of self-doubt. 

Should I be focusing on Meta — what am I doing.

I know what I don’t want to do and I want to leave Amazon. This environment is not good for me and it’s draining….

***Sacrfice: Love's Older Sister***

I wish for my child to perish,

In the fierce blaze of staunch conviction,

And in the blood of his unyielding belief.

As she exhales a final breath, I yearn to witness his gentle smile,

While I drown in a boundless sea of anguish,

Contemplating if this was her destiny, or a horrendous wrong.

For he shall fall, fueling the flames of righteous change,

Becoming greater than any woman who has graced this earthly plane.

And with his spilled blood, even Father Time shall stand, utterly stupefied.

History bears witness only to belief in tandem with action

My child shall not merely be a footnote

Instead, an entire, everlasting chapter...

Or so, fervently, I would wish.

**Adept interview**

```python
"""
We are going to build a simple tokenizer that breaks down some text (called a corpus) into smaller units called tokens. The first step is to build our vocabulary.

In our particular case, we would like to use the most frequent substrings that appear in the corpus for our vocabulary.

You are given a corpus `text` and a vocabulary size `n`. Return a dictionary of size `n` containing the most frequent substrings of all words:

# Clarifications

- We don’t care about runtime complexity, only correctness. Aim for the simplest solution here.
- The output dictionary does not need to be alphabetically arranged, i.e. any of the equivalent answers are acceptable (returning `sad` instead of `add` in the given example)

# Example Input

text = ["add", "sad", "mad", "lad", "dad"]
n = 8

# Example Output
    
    
"paris"

1...len(word)-1
word[0:]
{'a': 5, 'd': 7, 's': 1, 'm': 1, 'l': 1, 'ad': 5, 'add': 1, 'dd': 1}
"""

##

# {
#     "add": 1,
#     "ad": 1,
#     "dd": 1,
#     "a": 1,
#     "d": 2,
#     "sad": 1,
#     ...
# }

def tokenizer(text, n):
    output = {}
    
    for word in text:

        
        
        
        
        ## Two character
        # 0:2 
        # 1:3
        
        # One character strings
        # 0:1
        # 1:2
        # 2:3
    
    
        for i in range(len(word)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(word)+1):
            
                sliced_word = word[i:j]
              
                if sliced_word in output:
                    output[sliced_word] +=1
                else:
                    output[sliced_word] = 1
        
    freq = []
    
    for key in output:
        freq.append((output[key], key))
    
    freq.sort(reverse=True)
    
    freq = freq[0:n]
    
    res = {}
    
    for f, word in freq:
        res[word] = f
        
    return res
    
    # 

text = ["add", "sad", "mad", "lad", "dad"]
n = 8

print(tokenizer(text,n))

"""
Now that we have our vocabulary, let’s use it to tokenize some new text. Let’s define the probability of a particular token to be its frequency in the corpus divided by the sum of all frequencies of all the tokens in the vocabulary. So, in the example above, the probability of the token `a` is `5 / 22 = 0.2272727273`. 

The score of a particular tokenization is the product of all token probabilities. So, the score for the tokenization of `dadd` into `[d, a, d, d]` would be `0.318 * 0.227 * 0.318 * 0.318 = 0.007299`. Note that there is a tokenization with a better score: `[d, ad, d]` would be `0.318 * 0.227 * 0.318 = 0.022955`. This corresponds generally with what we want, which is to break down a word into the least amount of tokens.

Write a function `tokenize(str, vocab)` that takes in a new string and the vocabulary we just created, and returns the highest possible tokenization score.

# Clarifications

- The string will always be tokenizable
- Any answer with equivalent score is acceptable
- We do care about runtime and space efficiency here
- floating point errors are forgivable — 0.023 instead of 0.0229 for example will mean equivalently the same value. We accept answers within 1e-3 error margin.

# Example Input

text = "dadd"
vocab = {'a': 5, 'd': 7, 's': 1, 'm': 1, 'l': 1, 'ad': 5, 'add': 1, 'dd': 1}

tokenization = ["d", "a", "d", "d"]

p(token) = freq(token)/sum(all_frequencies)
score(tokenization) = p("d") * p("a") * p("d") * p("d")
"dad", "d"
p("dad") * p("d")
# Example Output

0.022955 # ["d", "ad", "d"]

AH hate feeling like like I don’t have control over my feelings 

# 2023-08-26

I feel extremely frustrated and angry. 

It has to do with me not getting promoted. Meetings with Binbin always make me want to ask her what is the reason why. Mainly because I feel like I deserve to get promoted, but I’m not. Seeing people around me.. just get promoted… I feel drained. It’s too much for me. I can’t keep this up anymore. 

Then there are all these overheads in my life:

1. the anatomy of my relationship with Nikita
2. getting asked to visit Morgantown but perhaps not having the heart to because I feel very unfree (not in a bad day but less mobility) there
3. working on startup
4. reading and writing more about things like education and city building
5. preparing for interviews 

I know I have to leave. I need to leave asap. I need to focus. I have an Adept interview. If I have an in with them and I get the offer, at least I know I’ll be able to leave and buy myself some time. 

Is this the optimal approach… I don’t know. Should I just focus on my startup?Work on startup and preparing for interviews? I should do both. I don’t know. I have this prime opportunity. Maybe I should take it and work for Adept. And then in the meantime continue to work on my startup. I feel like I still have a lot of things to learn. 

Ok lets do that. Mission put all eggs in the Adept basket.

I think the tough thing to admit sometimes is that your values don’t match with your actions. Deep down you know that it’s not ideal, but in the hopes that it’ll improve, you wait. What exactly are you waiting for is something that you might not even know. Perhaps for the feeling of alignment to happen. 

You effectively have three options:

(1) change your values

(2) abandon the situation

(3) wait and wait

So now you sit here and wonder, what exactly is the meaning of the wait. Are you scared to rip-off the bandaid? Do you think the bandaid would be hurt? Are their other advantages of having the bandaid on? Do you care about those advantages? Do you think having the bandaid doesn’t affect you, so it’s fine to leave it on?

Nikita’s letter

**Motiji**

Have you ever stopped to wonder why we call each other fat?

Is it because the other person is fat (which is true)

Or is it because of something that is more sinister

Perhaps not sinister

But there is something that both of us subconsciously do 

It’s because we wish there was more of that other person 

So much more that we physical manifest that

But maybe it’s not that deep

Maybe gappuji is just moti 

But she is sexer vala moti 

Soooo

But motiji also means warmth 

Because it feel warm when I’m near you

And talking to you 

And being with you 

But motiji is also because you are dense

Like a star - mewi star

Or maybe a black hole that collapsed on itself

Or maybe a quasar because you are mewi firework

And they look sexy 

I don’t want to end this letter

But from what I understand 

You have three puzzles to solve

**Authenticity and Purity**

Somewhere along the way he forgot to grow up. 

But maybe that’s what makes him different from the rest. 

But as soon as the tides can change, so did what I felt on our chance encounter. 

And it somehow just became stronger. 

It wasn’t infatuation or love or even really a crush. No, those terms were tainted with dishonesty and superficiality. He managed to bring out a sense of purity from out of me. A touch of authenticity, something that I always felt suppressed within me, but not quite exposed. 

Purity. I felt authentic. He taught me who I was supposed to be. And he did this all without even understanding what he was doing. 

Along the juvenile jokes that somehow wouldn’t be funny if said by someone else and the inquisitive smile that was reminiscent of a child learning about something he wanted to know, his eyes gave way to this deep nuance. He felt and thought things that not many could even attempt to fathom. 

It was this authenticity to life that gravitated, not attracted, me towards him. 

I slowly but surely realized that global optimality exists in the way one traverses through life. And he taught me that. I’m his.

As with so many of the introspective logs, this tends to be a part of it. 

I don’t feel intellectually motivated with Nikita. Our conversations are interesting and our deep dives are interesting, but I don’t sense novel information. I have to come to accept the fact that this might be something that never improves. I don’t know what to do here. [Talk to her about it]

Her relationship state is something that doesn’t seem to want to change. She is comfortable in the relationship and is largely emotional based. Sometimes this comes out within me, but I can’t refuse to notice that there is a lack of improvements. Changes are always initiated by me. She doesn’t have a problem with things I do. 

I don’t rely on her on my emotional/work well-being. In Europe, there was the time when my phone was lost and I was exhausted and there was an element of “what I am going to do” where her presence helped me. That was great. I would’ve been fine by myself, but that was still great. As for my work related issues, things have piled on and in general, I don’t feel like relying on her. I also don’t know *if* I’ll rely on her ever. 

## Next section (???)

I’m extremely exhausted and I’m trying to get Model Router done, but I want to work on Inferencio. I have a potential call with an investor and I think this idea might yield to something. 

I am ready to move on from this position. I’m waiting for the end of the month when I heard back from DOL to know the status of my green card. If I find out that I didn’t get it, I’m immediately quitting the company and applying for greencard to another company. If I do get it, then I’m set to leave the company as well because my I-140 should be filed 15 days after that. 

This means I can port this to another company and leave it. I could potentially move to Chicago or something of that manner for the quant job. 

Or this will give me clarity if I can move to SF. 

Vaageesha is on a F1 visa. I can have her start Inferencio and then join her as the first member of the company. That means I can raise money through her while still being on a TN. Problem is we’ll have to hire an immigration attorney to see if they can continue my I-140. No problem. Once we have raised money, we can figure that issue out. 

## Deadlines

I need to set self-imposed deadlines. My brain only works on grind mode. I want to complete reading a book. One book every 2 weeks. I want to replace free time spent scrolling with free time spent reading. 

**Ideal schedule** 

8:00 → wake up
8:30 - 14:00 → work 

14:00 - 22:00 → Tasks to do here:

1. passion projects/work to create value/interesting things (5 hours)
2. workout (1 hour)
3. socialization with humans (1 hour)
4. reading (1 hour) 

*remaining 1 hour is throwaway*

00:30 → sleep

There is a lot bubbling inside of me. I want to be honest in this document, but I am having trouble being honest because it is against my values… I think. 

## Relationship

Sometimes when I talk to Nikita, I feel this pressure to make the conversation interesting - *sometimes*. It’s because 

# 2023-03-0/08 (not exact)

Copies from collaborative journal document

# Collaborative journaling

## V

Not quite sure how to organize this but we can figure that out.

I think the issue boils down to, *why* do we want to be in a relationship and why are we in this one.

Gently put, unless your thoughts on this have changed, we necessarily don't.

A relationship to me is a state of co-existing that I don't care for. We choose to keep this intact because we see certain values to it.

### Evolution

I think due to the nature of time and the progression in the ideas, we look into the future and wonder what exactly this is being led to.

So therein lies the first shift. For youz the nature of this relationship has evolved into extraterrestrial family building whereas mine remains the same: simple, continuous improvement.

Since I don't quite have the inclination to raise kids, we are now stuck on this crossroads.

So I think really there are 3 possible path forwards:

1. We continue dating until one day, you or I decide it's enough. It's time to wrap it up so you can work on family building with others.
2. I change my values. While I'm fine with long-term union (not marriage), I'll have to change my views on raising kids.
3. You change your desire for marriage and raising kids to conjure up to mine.

I don't quite see any other options.

(1) is one that I'm not a big fan of. I think we have to do some soul-searching to see if it can be handled. But I'm open-minded to it.

As for (2), I'm willing to have the conversation and talk about it with you. We have had this conversation a few times, but with the relationship at *stake* at sorts, I think it's important

## Other thoughts...

### bizarre

While I understand we are "coming of age" in terms of deciding family/future/marriage plans, it's hard for me to see ourselves in terms of just the positions in our life to make decisions like that.

I'm not saying it's silly to make decisions like that, but I generally feel like... the concept is bizarre to put so much thought into something so fundamentally in the future.

### Fighting for what we believe in

I am not sure if our relationship is mature enough to even be considered in this class, but all great things are fought for... which is something I don't quite believe in for relationships, but maybe there is something to be said there...?

### Thinking about someone else

I know you clarified this over Ft, but maybe call it my naive view on our romance, but I'm not quite sure how to wrap my head around the fact if br-vala word is done, it'll be primarily done in the hopes that someone else is out there - *someone better (maybe much) suited for you is out there*. Because ad you have mentioned, you won't compromise on the human being in general. As a sidenote, someone like that would be quite special, knowing your uncompromising standards, so imo it would require a lot of searching/being single in the dating market (i.e. the game theory optimal move would be to start looking asap

I am not a big fan of that mindset  of the relationship. As far as I can tell, I don't have that view for someone like you.

I know I have general critiques for improvements that might at time seem finger-pointy at you, but at least up until now, you fit the bill of rights for the perfect companion. That being said, I guess I can envision a better relationship but that is only with you.

I don't quite know or am even interested in going through this again with someone else. It seems emotionally exhaustive to have to go through the routine with someone else: telling them about the past, building whatever we have built, etc etc. I guess a good critique here would be, if things were so great with us, why if I lost you, would I not try it with someone else. I think the answer to that primarily is, I don't have an intrinsic desire to subject myself to the whims of someone else's emotional array.

Wrapping this with the first thing about romance, I have throughout our conversations sense that you aren't quite aligned with this mode of thinking, which is alright, but it does make me wonder what exactly is this relationship building towards if not even that. I guess this might partially have to do with the fact that you greatly want to rear kids. So I take this that your desire to raise kids > desire to be with me > desire to be with someone else. That's sort of the equation.

# V

Equipped with some more thinking and a general wonderment with what you'all have to say, perhaps... I don't know... I don't want to think that you are holding out for someone more compatible in the future. The idea is... Weird to me.

It seems to be in direct antagony in what both of us believe.

I will always have a sense of superiority that there isn't anyone more incredible than me. But as a friend, it's my duty to be your best wisher. That means when time comes, hoping you find whoever will fill whatever I couldn't.

This idea is odd to imagine that I'm not the final destination of sorts because in  some ways, I think that is a necessity in a relationship of our nature.

# V

I was bombarded with another thought today. Not to beat a dead horse, but I do think this horse is a tinsey bit alive so maybe it can be beaten more...

This expiration date has been wild. Conceptually speaking, we were in a sense ready to break up over the singular fact that you want kids and I didn't.

Putting it together, we essentially said that we valued your desire to have kids over our relationship.

And my `maybe` as somehow put a bandaid over that.

But what about if in 6 months or one year or few years from now, I'm still undecided. Or, worse if I don't. Nikita... I don't know if I have it in me to go over the expiration date trepeditions again.

It also seems against our philosophy to date an imperfect version of the other person. In a sense, this makes me imperfect. I don't quite know how to put this... but raising kids for me isn't something I even imagine myself doing. The `maybe` stems from the fact that I think it'll be an interesting, that I'll be able to do some good, or something of that accords. I don't have an innate fatherhood desire.

This seems important. I, for whatever reason, don't fit into this perfect match that we have always felt you have described.

I know we have talked about this, but I think in a sense you had made peace with the fact that we'll break up. In a way, you have a sense that there is an alternate person that exists that would better fit your needs. So if that is the case, I don't know if God made us for each other.

I just can't help but feel that you are settling for something sub-optimal. This might also mess up your whole life. What if you date me for a long time, and then think back, and for some reason, you don't find someone, and then kind of think that there might've been someone better - that dating me was a mistake. I don't want to be responsible from robbing you a husband that wants an amazing grandiose wedding, raising kids with you, and share all the joys in familyhood with you.

From a cost of ageing perspective, the more time you spend in the market the better right. Based on your highly intensive crtierias... what if someone else exists who is going to perfectly solve this problem... they will most likely not be available in the market after a while.

I can't help but feel that I am trapping you. If we were going to indeed break-up over this... on second thoughts my uncertainty can't be relied on.

Solo trave

The desire to share the incredible things I’m seeing is sublime. 

Getting excited to go back to Seattle. 2 weeks was definitely a long time. 

After the Ryan thing with Nikita, I certainly felt anger while she was telling me the story. 

But I do really believe I calmed down and understand there wasn't anything wrong. The way they touched each other was fine. Visit this back — i think I'm more conservative about this than I think I am. 

The current topic seems like we are deciding to break up or not. In a way, she is deciding what her thoughts are on the expiration date. 

What are my thoughts? 

I don't want it to exist obviously. 

# 2023-03-05

I need a mechanism to purge my thoughts, so I think this here will do. 

For some reason after seeing Nikita staying up late and talking to Ryan reminded me of how little we talked. 

Even the outburst she had in SF where I was busy, but she was just crying wasn't discussed or the journal she wrote. 

The last SF trip also didn't really have us discuss anything related to that, and I feel to a level we didn't discuss anything on the stack. This was perhaps on the grounds that stack conversations were emotionally exhaustive. 

For the last couple of months, in all the busyness, there was no time made to talking. 

Yet there is was at 2 am and she was up talking to Ryan and perhaps other friends. 

It's not jealousy because Ryan is a guy which my brain is wanting me to clarify. It's just puzzlement to see what is happening and why am I feeling this way. 

Does this feel torturous? Is there element of active suppressant to what I am feeling because I don't want to make this a big deal but my feelings are unaligned with that logicality. 

Yes, it's not a big deal, but do I truly feel that way? 

A stern talk of such is something I want to have with Nikita. We did when I landed in Lisbon after my flight from Porto. It was about the frequency of us talking. 

I guess, after that, what I really wonder is what she really plans on doing with the relationship. What sentimentality does she have for this? Where does she proceed this going in the sense that conversationally we are lacking any sort of insight into each other's feelings. 

Moments like this make me ponder if the severing of this relationship is necessary. Not because of a lack of romantic feelings, but if these feelings are generally uncalled for, perhaps that's a way of freeing myself up from them. 

Another point is wondering if Nikita herself thinks about these things to the depth that I do. I don't know. I have my doubts she does. Is this a general sign of incompatibility? I'm not sure. 

But I think writing this down, I feel like my feelings of frustration (I think) stems from confusion - confusion if she cares a out this all, if she thinks about it, and what are we proceeding towards. 

We haven't been able to talk about the expiration date conversation. She tends to start crying and it becomes very difficult to continue that. I feel like there is an aspect of this road to the previous point. 

Maybe she is fine with the shallowness here… I think she doesn't think about those things. It's only brought up when I bring it up or if she rarely thinks about them. 

Anyways chao.

Love is respect. 

You truly love someone based on acknowledging their superiority in the things you value. 

You take the top X (X \approx 10) and if a person is superior to you in more than 50% of those things you value, you can readily fall in love with them granted you have an existing relationship with them.

 

---

Let me see if I can come up with my top 10: 

1. Intellect /witty comebacks/being well informed/a large knowledge repertoire that can be molded multidisciplinararily

2. Curiosity 

3. Grit/hard work/being disciplined

4. Resiliency to being affected by unexpected changes --- also emotional resiliency (not emotionally distant) but allowing things to not have a drastic affect if they are unimportant 

5. Passion about ideas and abstract concepts 

6. Spontaneity/being averse to being in a routine/desire to continue to make my own life more interesting 

7. Being unaffected by the status quo and sharing/practicing active thoughts and ideas to challenge notion -- and being preachy about it in a way 

8. Superiority/god complex 

9. Being open to the idea of "God" --- meaning being so open-minded that new and hard to digest ideas can be understood and adopted 

10. Being discontent - complacency is evil and being discontent is the only thing that truly pushes humans and de facto humanity.

I'll add an 11th in case some feel like a duplicate 

11. Romanticizing life - waking up and appreciating each day and embracing all the possibilities for it and not letting minor (or to a certain degree semi-major) perturb it 

New one that Natasha brought up that might potentially be it:

1. Values community

# 2022-12-16

I think it’s the story that we all chase for. I have always believed and shared the sentiment that stories are the currencies that makes a human valuable. In a way, living is maximizing your own perceived quality of stories. For example, when you hear stories what captivates you - if it’s pure in motive, it might be worth pursuing. 

First things first, we must understand priorities and work on task completion. 

# 2022-12-06

Time: 2:20 AM 

I’m up because I need to work and was thinking about working out. That’s fine. 

Nikita being here might fix my sleep schedule. 

Opened up Introspection Log to basically discuss how Nikita’s “party” past affects me. 

Writing this down, it doesn’t seem like it affects me. 

I was just thinking when Shree Kulkarni and I were talking yesterday and how she brought up that she was a major “party chick” that it bothered me a bit. And even in the car ride when I brought it and she was talking about the Indian Frat it bothered me. Also when we were walking back home, clearly there was something about it because I was bringing it up jokingly but sort of in a it bothers me. 

Laying this down here help me. I think I understand it shouldn’t bother me… and it doesn’t so I shouldn’t let it. 

I guess to expound on this, it just reminds me of our differences a lot more. 

# 2022-11-29

Time: 04:27

I find myself to clear headed in a way that I understand what's hindering my thoughts from focusing on important things

For the first time in a long time, I was able to shut down work and focus on something new — different thing sand certainly not focused. 

Maybe I need to start talking to more people about my thoughts because maybe talking to Suhani inspired me in a way. Or maybe productively grinding. 

I am reading and now thinking about my relationship again. I don't want to. It's useless. Focus on reading and going to bed. 

Time: 05:10 

My natural thoughts while I try o sleep is just churning into animosity for Nikita in a way. I think talking to her properly has become quite necessary. 

I don't know what the root cause is or why it's happening. I just want to be free of it. 

I want to focus on something more interesting like the book I was reading or something of that sorts.

 

My world periphery is small - I want to increase it. I don't think she goes through this, and I wonder why. For some reason, I don't want to give her the sense of satisfaction that I am affected by this relationship, but I guess I am. 

My urge to distract myself from these thoughts almost led me to stop typing and go to YouTube or something. I won't let distraction win. 

My brain is also pondering break-up. Hmm… 

My brain could be running this fast because maybe I didn't exercise today or woke up late. Time to go for a run… 

Time: 20:19 

I don’t know why I feel like crying, but for some reason I need to have the conversation with Nikita. She mentioned if we should have the conversation now or 1.5 hours from now, and obviously, I mentioned later. But I think I preferred right now. What is happening to me… why can’t I focus. What are my thoughts.

Letter for Nikita

**Why am I not in love?**

I don’t believe in god, but I become strangely religious thinking about you. It almost seems like you were perfectly made for me. 

My heart flutters sometimes at the most minutest things you do. I am physically compelled to burst into songs or smile randomly or just stare at you and not want to talk. 

I am a child and will never grow up but you don’t make me want to grow up and I love that about being with you 

# 2022-11-25

Time: 3:48 PM 

Yesterday we went to Bainbridge and hung out with Kawin. It was fun and quite a productively packed day. Felt like there were aspects of novelty and generally seemed like a fun day. Reminder: tell people to bring jackets whenever it’s called smh. 

After coming back, my intention was to get some work done, but through some derivation of fatigue, I didn’t and ended up staying up wasting time on my phone. Need to fix this about me. Maybe need to change environments to shift this. 

Additionally, want to translate the sort of productive packness of these last few days into more knowledage and building something packness. 

# 2022-11-24

Time: 12:40 

Yesterday was an interesting day. It seemed like the light outside positively affected me in a bit, but it might've just been the sleep in all fairness. Meditated and did ab workout in the morning. 

Work was productive with minimal distractions and got some aspect of the Model Router MMS Resource Store figured out. 

After work, went home and made some eggs. This was around 18:00 and then ate. Parima called and talked to her as I walked to the Climate Pledge Arena for the Kraken vs Sharks game. 

The game was amazing. Witness:

1. Proposal 
2. Lot of hype
3. NHL fight
4. Power plays 
5. Really interesting game 
6. Vibes were amazing 

After the game, soon went on a run with Natasha where she mentioned her relationship woes. 

During the conversation, I felt quite coherent. When I was talking, I would hint at points and then round those about. Feel like in the past I didn't do that. Discovered a lot of new things about Natasha. It was interesting to learn that she was also insecure about her looks. The guy she was dating in a way validated that. People are fascinating. The way you feel is so extrinsically motivated in a way. 

I also told her about my lack of risk taking and desire to jump-in head first into *novel* situations - which I guess the last few days has been with buying midi keyboard, motorcycle license, and NHL games - and now today Bainbridge. This dialogue felt like I was being quite clear with the problems that I have had with myself in the past, and in a way what I want to change. It felt good. 

Walked her back home because w don't trust the streets of Seattle. Coming back, on the intersection of Minor and Stewart there is a 7 eleven. Guy was laying diagonally. His legs was sort of doing a climbing motion. I noticed and called 911. 

After a while people were obviously watching. There was a dude who looked poorer with the medics trying to talk to the dude on the ground. The dude was on a high - they mentioned heroine

 

Medic waited quite a bit before they paged the ambulance. They just tried getting him up. Ambulance came after maybe 15 min. I took videos. They didn't apply narcan (naloxone) anything like that. 

Yep, that's it! 

# 2022-11-22

I am distracted. Stop being distracted. Focus. Meditate. And fix whatever the issue is.

Be open with yourself and what you want. Try to be more bottom-up. 

# 2022-11-19

Lets see… What do I want to spill my heart about. 

First, with the catharsis of writing there comes another aspect of writing; it’s the manifestation. While there are certain thoughts that certainly come in my head, I try to think about the focus of it. 

So let’s try to explore one of them. Nikita and I discuss other crushes in our life. One of them that is recurrent is Tania. Reason is that there are many facets of Tania that when described on paper fits the criteria of an interesting intellectual partner. And perhaps in our interactions, there is this certain prime. 

However, I don’t believe there is an underlying attraction. I think deep down I, and I suspect others, naturally do this based on our sexuality. As in, “Ah is this person attracted to me. I’m so great and we shared this moment, must be.” But this doesn’t necessarily evolve into a crush, and in my opinion shouldn’t otherwise that would kind of undermine the relationship I’m in. 

That’s what my interactions and evolving friendship (obviously hard to attach this term because I do use it scarcely) with Tania is. It’s because this happens with other people. Just because Tania meets more of the bill of rights than other people, doesn’t quite entail anything because as discovered perhaps certain feelings of transparency and other things that I find important aren’t present. 

The same kind of ideology can be applied to other people; celebrities streamers, etc. For example, Alexandra and Andrea Botez as streamers. I do find their personalities and styles to be quite appealing, but that is where it stops. 

Ok now that we addressed this, there is another thing in my mind. 

On 2022-11-17, Nikita and I had two conversations: one in the morning and one at night. This was after Nikita’s trip from NYC. We hadn’t talked in a while. 

In the morning she cried because of a joke I made while she was crying not reassuring her because I was imitating a baby. Perhaps it was insensitive for me, but in the call, as I am right now, the nature of my humor is quite attached to my identity. I did not mean that in mocking way. Before she started crying, I was in a hurry as there was a livestream I wanted to catch, but her crying delayed that. This reminded me of when she was crying in San Francisco while I had to respond to some pings, and I couldn’t address her in the moment. Also similarly when I was in Morgantown, and I didn’t want to talk about the Maun Vrat Day but in a way I did. We have yet to address that. Another aspect of her being upset was that I wasn’t comfortable sparing 4 hours to talk as I was working on Model Router and felt that would be too much time. 

Later the night, we talked about this (the crying about using the baby thing to mock), and perhaps there was a sense of anguish that I felt because I wasn’t quite sure what the crying was or why it was important. Writing this, I feel the sensation of crying. Perhaps, just thinking about that feeling. I believe we were able to resolve that, though I would like to follow up on that. 

The later point of this conversation was discussing the birthday apology. The conversation honestly seemed like we were just discussing various semantics. I was trying to make it as clear as possible about my views on birthday. 

At some point in the conversation, we reached a natural break and perhaps were about to say the byes and disconnect. Nikita, instead, hung up abruptly. I call her back and I wish I could explain this well, but there was some logical frustration within me. In hindsight, this was something I would say even if I had a day to think because it felt like the most honest thing to say - “I’m done with this.” And I really was. The hanging up and this particular instance (which I would say was probably the first that ever happened - there was another instance where it wasn’t a hang-up but more of just ignoring but that was not as serious). This, obviously upset her and she started crying, but as soon as I quickly explained my point of how I was frustrated and how I feel like I have to wrap my [**emotions when presenting it to her**](https://www.notion.so/Introspection-Log-2015-08-18-2024-01-01-64ffe99425194f08a97206f0ed26e647?pvs=21), she immediately understood and apologized. 

Our relationship has devolved into this huge just conversation lists that we haven’t talked about. Thinking about it is certainly intimidating, but my memory is able to find things from literally MONTHS (maybe 5) ago. 

In a way, after that conversation and before that, I have been questioning the longevity of the relationship. I really wonder if love is written for us and what all this is. If this is what happens after a disagreement or something that can’t be resolved where there is just multiple pile-up conversations. This also happened once during the journaling conversation where there was quite a bit of time before a conversation took place. It seems like we have an aversion to talk about anything real. Whenever we do, there is something about making sure everything is aligned properly and we have the perfect amount of time or something like that to discuss the subject. 

### Emotions when presenting it to her

When I said that comment to her, it just felt right. There was a certain obvious truth to that statement that was just underlyingly present within our strenuous conversations in the last couple of months. 

### Writing and Maun Vrat Day has made me more indifferent about the relationship

In a way, writing and Maun Vrat Day has made me more indifferent to resolving things. In a similar way to which Nikita forgets things, I’m able to keep my feelings of resolution away and carry on. I like that more, but I wonder then what this relationship has become. 

### Being true to what the relationship represents

The inception of this relationship was built on the concept of critically examining the other person’s role in your life, and if there is a net benefit. Easier put in words than in practice, but I feel like such is not the case. Nikita has mentioned and seems like this pressurizes her in a way. 

### Things I want to think about

While I don’t know if this is related to all the relationship thinking, but I want to go back and think about my dreams of grandeur and illustriousness and doing something great. That is my life’s goal. And I won’t let anything or anyone stop me. I will mercilessly cut down anything or anyone that slows me down because I don’t have any other purpose other than profoundly impacting the humans on this planet and learn as much as possible. 

If it may require tough decisions, such shall be the way. 

### Final Notes

Lets see… is there anything else I want to mention. For now, nope. Cool! Cya!

# 2022-11-03

What I find that whenever there is a lot on my mind, I kind of find ways of just occupying myself by watching YouTube, playing chess (doing both at once) or just scrolling through my phone. 

It’s ridiculous that this still happens to me. I should know how to cure this, yet this happens. 

I want to vent out every single thought that I have as unfiltered as possible in this post because it seems like it’s mainly because of Nikita that my mind is occupied. We haven’t had the chance to properly talk about these which haven’t allowed me to discourse this through my head, but perhaps this post will. It most definitely will - it always does. 

Note to myself: ALWAYS WRITE WHEN YOU FEEL YOU ARE UNPRODUCTIVE. Your brain needs to have it’s strands straightened to be hyper-performant. 

These are the points I want to bring up with Nikita. 

1. Is she excited to talk to me?
On October 31st, we had scheduled a call. Before the call, she mentioned she was busy with work. That’s fine/amazing. But it seems like on the day she was watching House - which is fine, but this makes me question if we are compatible. 

For example, if I had work things to do, I definitely could forego the call. But to watch a show, I would constantly think about the call. Obviously on the flip side, this could simply be her working a bit and then later deciding to watch a show at night, but there is something where talking to me doesn’t fulfill that (unclear though - clarify this later). This goes back to one of the point that I sent her before Maun Vrat day about actively choosing to watch TV over talking to me - which is something I don’t see myself doing.

I understand that her brain for most of the time seeks out short-term gratification, and so perhaps talking to me doesn’t satisfy that. There is a bit to dissect here. 
2. Why does it take Nikita and I such a long time to discuss things that should be discussed?
There are aspects of the conversation that even after our visit that we haven’t covered. Is there really a lack of time that we can’t find. That can’t be. 

Should we start logging how we spend time talking to each other and interacting with each other. 
3. The call on October 30th or 29th, where Nikita started crying and yelling regarding her birthday. I want to ask her, how it would feel like if I yelled at her? 

What sort of relationship are we striving for here? 

Initially, I mentioned the notion of perfection. Emotions should always be controlled. There shouldn’t be any sort of slip ups. Is this fine and aligned behavior? Should we continue dating in that scenario. 
4. I think the fact that she knew ho she felt by talking bad about the birthday thing and potentially me, and yet she wasn’t able to bring up that it hurt her seems makes it seems like she wasn’t emotionally aware of herself.

Also not giving someone something for a birthday is not a big deal. It’s a bit hypocritical of her considering our relationship is not built on gift-giving whatsoever. If it was, I would’ve received things from her and the sentiment might’ve been shared. 
5. Do I feel comfortable feeling vulnerable to her?
I feel like there is a part of me that hides what I am feeling to her whenever things aren’t the best. This includes my thoughts and how my day is going (in terms of productivity). 

Why is that? Shouldn’t in a relationship that not only you share your vulnerabilities, but your vulnerability is discovered by them as well?
6. She wasn’t able to identify my general rut. She didn’t point out I wasn’t reading a book. Or meditating. Or working out. Or working on a startup/project idea. Or looking into companies. 
7. The previous point brings me to another, does she know what drives me?
8. It seems that it’s hard for us to discuss new sort of things. Either she is tired, has a headache, or plain hasn’t thought about something. 

For example, when we were discussing about the moral qualms that I had about drinking, it seemed like she was getting angry at me. 
9. I think in our relationship, we sort of go our merry way suppressing big conversational points. This seems to be causing our relationship to not grow as much. 

Do we want our relationship to grow? ← question to pose to her
10. In Morgantown, when I wasn’t in the mood to talk about the “i find you annoying” thing, but she really wanted me to. And when I caved in, she only asked me once but in a forceful way. It seems that if she was tired or something, we wouldn’t talk about it. But in this case, it was fine. 

After writing this journal, I want to tell her about it. It seems like I enjoy sharing good feelings with her. But I also know that she’ll be curious about what the journal is about and be worried it’s about her, perhaps bothering her. Does the fact that she’ll be bothered, *elates* (not sure about the right word) me? ← Discuss with her.

There is something unsettling to what I am doing.

It feels like my life has an invisible structure with anchors and maybe I have identified them, but can I break free from them?

## Thinking model

It is not possible to have an in-depth knowledge of everything. For things with moderate interest/quick learn, it’s important to have sufficient knowledge. This can be for your own enlightenment, for others (via communication), or just general recount. 

There are certain questions you should have an answer to. We’ll refer to this article as a basis for an example: https://www.si.com/nfl/2022/09/16/chargers-qb-justin-herbert-tests-after-rib-chest-injury 

1. Who?
    1. Justin Herbert is the Chargers QB. Taking it a level deeper
    2. Chargers is the Los Angeles Chargers
2. What?
    1. He’ll be undergoing tests. 
3. Why?
    1. Rib/chest injury
4. Where?
    1. 
5. When?
    1. 
6. How?

### How to Achieve Immortality?

# 7/15/2022

### An Essay on Love

This is a topic that I have pondered for years. I hope that in a flurry of text dispel, I’ll be able to make a slight breakthrough in my understand of this.

To approach this subject, I have chosen to go about this analytically and then embed the emotionality and the irrationality that comes about it. By nature the analytics of it comes the easiest to me be but more than this there is a generality to which the analytical method can be applied. A sort of universality feels, at least to me, a much more useful representation of the truth.

We must first understand the separate components. Hopefully once we have the modular infrastructure setup, we can build it up to something useful. 

A subject of this abstractness doesn’t have useable datapoints. So lets use anecdotal evidence and see if it helps us go somewhere. 

A friend once asked me if I had ever fallen in love. I told them, “I think so… yes… I’m not sure. In the moment it felt quite intense.” At the time I wasn’t even referring to a relationship but a crush I had. Privy to the biological whims, I accepted that as is, an immature comprehension of something I knew could be very well incorrect. 

Looking back, I was not in love. But it wasn’t a useless feeling. A postmortem analysis of it helped me understand (at least to a degree) what it was. It was an intense admiration of a friend who made me excited to learn about things. This - to me - seemed like what really love was. I very much enjoyed this definition because it came from a place of rationality and general benefit. A person you love should be someone you admire and someone who helps you grow. 

Great! Was that it? Well, no. While this was certainly an aspect of it, this shortsighted checkbox didn’t quite entail how I, as an individual, felt. 

Enter reciprocity. At the core of the advancement of human civilization, from the creation of the wheel to the invention of the lightbulb, there has been a core idea of transaction. While unhealthy to think of relationships and actions in that way, it’s a healthy exercise to stop and actually understand how you have touched people’s lives and how they have yours. 

Ok so now clearly you can see how I can see where this enters in love. Love is reciprocity. Love is an implicit contract that, just like a mutalistic example, benefits both people. The idea of reciprocity is what really binds humans together and creates this idea of the bond that is so ever hard to describe. 

Ok so to recap, so far we have **reciprocity, admiration, and helping you grow.**

Well no… and this was one of the hardest points for me to discover and I have yet to understand it. Over the top intensity in how you feel about the individual. There isn’t a good word for it. During my periods of introspection, I kept on revisiting this. 

I originally thought that this association came from the movie/show portrayal of love. The classic kiss in the rain and over the top gestures. While these are completely bullshit, I have discovered that love is indeed supposed to be this magical over the top, irrational feeling. What I think this becomes confused with is lust that tends to fade and that the general populace associates with the honeymoon period. That’s not what I’m quite referring to. 

The magicalness is almost unending and while the idea of soulmate is probabilistically and foolishly sought out for, it’s a certain configuration of two healthy individuals that creates this magicalness. I also don’t think the magicalness necessarily comes at the beginning. I honestly think it truly comes after an abundant understanding of another individual. 

That feeling of being on the moon, the flutter in the stomach, it can certainly fade after a while but if it can’t be rediscovered again then I’m not sure if that is love. 

# 5/10/2022

I’m tired.

I can’t keep on doing this shit. Every. Single. Fucking. Day I actively choose to overwhelm myself with work... or allow it to overwhelm me...?

I’m not even sure. My day just blurs around this, and I know it is my fault. Everyday an issue comes about and I just can’t seem to fucking understand how there is so much to think about and the precision with which you have to think about it. 

Am I cut out for this? Is there something 

# 5/2/2022

These are relationship points that I have been meaning to talk to Nikita about but haven’t had the chance. 

I thought about this entry for quite a bit and even told you about it... but when trying to put words to *paper* there was an aspect of uncertainty if this would lead to any catharsis of sorts. And if it wouldn’t lead to any emotional release... was there even a point. 

In this journal, you’ll see that I have mentioned a few people that I have talked to a few of these things. Normally the order of operations would be different where I would normally bring something up to you first or maybe immediately tell you afterwards. Without stating the obvious, both of us have had incongruent schedules and have been quite busy (not just you), so I still find this acceptable. 

## Closing Remarks

*copying the closing remark here and it’ll be present in the end to provide some perspective before you begin reading this.* 

I hope if you read this without me going through this with you that you understand the straightforwardness and don’t see it as an acute criticism of our relationship. 

Our relationship has a lot of goods, but at the end of the day, our goal should be an exponential increase towards what we perceive as our goals. The benchmark for our relationship should be this massive thruster to help the other person get there... otherwise how is it any different from a friendship. And if that is what it is, then maybe we should honestly address it as such. 

## Spark

This conversation goes back to two stank items: one related to conversation with Pranav and one with Khushboo and Shatayu. In general some aspects of this whole post (not just section) has been discussed with Tania, Suhani (I think), Dhara (I think), and Krithik (I think). I don’t think any other names come to my head

As I mentioned, the spark or the initial infatuation associated with a crush didn’t exist with you. When we first started dating, it was a series of good conversations and an amazing amazing friend that I can share anything with and that is what it has persisted till. There hasn’t been a deterioration by any means in this area. 

But when I think of my other crushes in the past, this was a feeling that I have realized is indicative of an overwhelming feeling that one might describe as love. 

And talking to Pranav, he mentioned that he is in a similar boat. The overwhelming sensation exists and happens, but the head-over-heals and the irrationality isn’t as ever-present as I want to experience. 

This isn’t something that can be forced, and I’ll be a realistic and mention that there is an uncertainty if this can be achieved. I do, however, feel that the predicate of being in-person is quite important for this. 

That said, our relationship exists in a state of perpetual uncertainty. Neither of us are (or should) willing to make an ounce of sacrifice for the relationship at the expense of more important things, which extends this uncertainty.

## Knowledge Transaction

My lust for learning stems from two fears of mine: not being able to amount to substantial impact and a feeling of emotional and intelligent unsatisfaction. Not sure if you have noticed this within the year of dating me, but I experience this sort of anxiety when I feel like I’m not absorbing enough new things.

One of my favorite discord channels that we have is the #vids-and-articles and I truly enjoy when you share with me things that I feel I can learn (and when we have time to discuss). In some sense, it can be seen as outsourcing the way I learn. For example, in one of my past crushes, I felt this was something that formed the bedrock of my attraction. 

I know we have talked about this a bit, but I don’t think this is a prevalent part of our relationship. I by no means am blaming you here because upon reflecting on this, I realize I haven’t pushed on this as much as I should for how important I consider this. 

I guess the point I am trying to get at is that it’s not about the teaching point that we have brought up so many times as much as that I don’t quite get to witness your intellectual interests. I know you have SO MANY, but I’m a bit disappointed that I haven’t seen the range. Something that Shatayu asked me was what feed you use to gather knowledge, and I realized that I only know about the social media feeds that you scroll. 

In the year that we have dated, I feel like I should’ve seen more of this range. While I understand that there are can be a month or two purely devoted to perhaps what’s happening or the task in hand, it’s hard to say that you haven’t learned anything else or read something interesting. 

This might also be misaligned perspective. In my case, whenever I read something interesting or something I think you’ll like, I get this urge to share with you and I immediately do. This also comes in forms of pursuing different things and then wanting to tell you about it. 

The knowledge transaction scheme I think is foundational to my attraction and in some subversive way, maybe holding me back from liking you more. 

As an addendum (and this is purely my perspective), I think both of us have felt that there might be this implicit wait of *this might improve -*  example “ah there is this class or there is this something that is preventing this.” While I understand time is a commodity, there is also something to be noted that the accumulation of knowledge on your own accords has to happen with conscious thought. There will always be something happening: vacationing, meeting people, work, first big project, etc etc. I think if we pause everything and just attend to what’s on hand and don’t tend to this more fundamental needs, it could lead to massive levels of unsatisfaction. 

## Liking Other People

This section isn’t quite about Rohith per se and there isn’t really a recency bias. Wanted to clarify that in case you thought that haha. 

We are each others many firsts - physically and emotionally. And I wonder if in some sense this clouds our judgement. 

When I like someone Nikita, I don’t ever want to feel like it was determined by luck or fate. And this holds more true for being in a relationship with someone. I understand it’s a naïve perception because at the end of the day the jumble of people you end up with is purely by chance. 

But I like, or more so need, this conviction that whatever would’ve happened at least in a limited sense that we would’ve somehow ended up together. 

Let me clarify. There is certainly a huge aspect of luck in how we met, and it could’ve very well not happened. But lets say you found out that Akul was interested in you? How woudl that be romantically pursued? How would that have panned out if you would’ve met me? Would you have left Akul/would you have not? Or what about Rohith? What if we weren’t dating? 

While the above line of questioning might come of as me being insecure, I give it to you in full faith that I’m not - in fact it’s quite the opposite. These are simply lines of reasoning that I think is important to understand the sanctity of our relationship. Also I know these questions are hard to answer, as the hypothetical is, in fact, a *hypothetical.*

The kind of people we meet is up to the whims of entropy and as I have mentioned before. There is a certain way of the universe aligning similar people together (granted they are *healthy* to being with). 

Is there this conviction that we have that we are the best for each other? Or are we just in each others way - to put it coarsely - for the time being? Is there someone that exists right now that would be better for us? That we have met or maybe not met? How do evaluate when we are not right for each other? 

In essence, is the other person really that special or have we just convinced ourselves of that? 

To also put, I empathize with the *crushy* feeling - so please don’t see this as me placing blame or anything like that. There is a certain naturalness to this. 

## Communication

This point is completely unrelated to the previous ones.

We haven’t had enough confrontations with each other, but at times I have noticed that we sometimes have a differing approach. 

I’m so sorry if this seems finger-pointy because that’s not my intention whatsoever. There is most definitely things that I do that aren’t ideal. This is just a way for me to develop that conversation. Obviously this is my perspective (so very very biased), but I have found at times that whenever there is a small misunderstanding I think the default that tends to be applied is I wasn’t paying attention (again this doesn’t happen frequently). The phrase associated with is “you weren’t listening...”

Obviously, there has never been a time where you have been talking about something substantial that I haven’t properly attended to. If I’m not able to pay 100% attention, I believe I always mention that I’m a bit distracted. So I do hope that you take it that sometimes I just wasn’t able to properly comprehend that. 

Another point is sometimes I feel that there could be a proneness to jump to a conclusion - once again this doesn’t happen often. I have found that sometimes I preface quite a bit due to this, or tend to make sure I deliver the idea in the right idea. While I totally understand this is a me thing, I would like to be able to get to the point where I don’t have to do this with my own girlfriend.

## How have we improved due to each other?

I believe this is a question that we should continuously revisit as this is one of the foremost tenets in our relationship. 

I want to understand more of this from my perspective. There are quite a few ways in which I have been affect by you, but I feel much of it is subtle. Apart from the points that I have mentioned, that talking to you allows me to gain clarity and approach things at a different angle among other points - I still  need your help to make this less subtle. 

I think in some sense this is sort of what separates the line of friendship and relationship. Not saying a friendship shouldn’t positively impact you, just that a relationship should do it more.

## Closing Remarks

I hope if you read this without me going through this with you that you understand the straightforwardness and don’t see it as an acute criticism of our relationship. 

Our relationship has a lot of goods, but at the end of the day, our goal should be an exponential increase towards what we perceive as our goals. The benchmark for our relationship should be this massive thruster to help the other person get there... otherwise how is it any different from a friendship. And if that is what it is, then maybe we should honestly address it as such. 

Yours truly,

Viraat

Note about catharsis that I originally mentioned: I do feel this sense of catharsis and glad I salvaged time for this :)) 

# 3/18/2022

There is a sense of self that I need to understand. 

My days have blurred into distractions where I work more than anything, but many times I find myself not intensely focused on the work - thinking about random things. 

There is an intentionality behind my actions that I am missing:

- *Why am I doing what I am doing?*
- *What is it for?*
- *Do I really care?*

# 3/16/2022

My efficiency feels rejuvenated. I hope the reason is not because of the Sun, but I am confident it’s not. 

I want to embed of sense of calmness when I think about things, and go through it with a throttle of completion. 

This is akin to when I’m slightly tired so my excited or *jumpiness* is a bit reduced which leads me to read and focus more. Perhaps we should coin a term here? The Drowsiness Effect. It’s not sleep deprivation per se just a bit of tiredness that allows us to focus more. 

I have been thinking more and more about going to Mexico City. I want to build my own life’s stories, and I feel like I’m not sticking true with that. Perhaps Mexico City will allow me to start doing that. 

Maybe the confusion or perhaps turmoil in my heart will be reduced when I’m able to go and do something completely alone with just myself as the focus. 

I want to meet interesting people but also give myself ample of time to process it. 

# 3/13/2022

I want to granularize my thought process into strands I can properly process. My concurrent thinking has not permitted to quite operate at the level I want to be. 

Ok so lets start with the basic one. This is a new one - using names in my journal.

I am currently dating Nikita. This has been interesting and what I have slowly started realizing is that thinking about certain things might make me *afraid* (? couldn’t think of a good alternate to this word but I think it would be the most akin to this). 

My limbic system has clearly gotten the message that I like her. I sometimes wonder if the response of infatuation was like with the one that I had with Annabel, Anita, or maybe someone else. The fruition of those were, though, quite obvious - it was based on a realistic understanding of those people. Those initial feelings were always founded on a innate social immaturity and lack of recognizing who we were. 

This time it’s different. I now Nikita. And I like her. I don’t say it convince myself now - which might’ve been the case when we started dating. Our honesty in communication and level of transparency we are expected to bring to our thoughts has allowed myself to be vulnerable with our in a very open way. 

The idea of *love* is still weird to me though. I’m not sure what it is. When I brought this conversation up with Nikita, I was clear and she also realized that the way for me to fall in love is trepidatious or perhaps difficult. 

I am very aware of what I *require* in a relationship, and I have told her that maybe all of those needs are not met yet. But I do like her. I don’t think love is a puzzle piece or anything like that - just a union of people who are willing to go to a massive length for another. Love needs to allow the other person to grow - otherwise it’s not love but asphyxiation. In my opinion though, if you are choosing to love someone renewed with all the decisions laid on the table... shouldn’t this *love* help you grow to bounds that you never knew 

I have gotten the urge to say the *l-word* as I like to joke, but it’s quite evident that I don’t really know what it is. There is a hypocrisy in what I said. If what I told Nikita is really true (that I don’t feel like her [and by corollary perhaps me as well] help each other throttle to the max rapid progression of growth), then the urge that I feel to say the *l-word* is some weird interference of maybe society affecting my vocabulary. Or maybe a word like this doesn’t exist hence the whole word not filling 

It’s clear though that there is a cognitive dissonance. Perhaps neither of us are emotionally mature yet. While I won’t speak for Nikita, it’s clear that both of us struggle with the basics of time management. If I consider this to be my biggest flaw, then I’m not necessarily aided. But be it as it maybe, part of the growth needs to come from within.

While I look out into the water, my hands jittering from the cold, and sparkles of the city, I ask myself what is to become of me. Writing about Nikita and how I feel, in utmost honest, is something that I hope will lead to a catharsis post-writing. While my thoughts aren’t consumed at a capacity, I need to understand that this arrangement needs to be explored a bit further before devoting more mental energy that is not fetching anything. 

It’s certainly not *love* but is there a potential for it? Perhaps... but the intellectual excitement seems to be a prerequisite. As with all things, I’m not pointing fingers at her. This is more of a reflection onto myself. Understanding my time bounds and building more free time is the name of the game. To use it productively will require more mental fashioning - one that I hope that I can achieve soon. 

In the meantime, it seems my compartmentalization about her and various aspects of our relationship is good. #public-stank helps dump any thoughts I might have and want to discuss. I always wonder what good has being in a relationship done to me. The fact that I’m writing this and discussing intricacies in my feelings mean that this is a good sign. I’m growing to understand how to improve myself. 

# 3/11/2022

The name of the game is focus and realignment. I need to find things that I believe in and achieve my lacking immediately. 

Given a single day, we aren’t going full forth and achieving everything we can. Ok lets see what we can do today.

**Cringing as I Write This**

Ok. You don't need to wr

ite this. Even though Swagat and Michael Yan are going to ISEF your robotics team literally won WORLDS, like we are the best team in the world. In terms of resumé value you are leagues ahead. True you don't get to meet Tanisha or don't get to go to LA which is cool, but you can't let this hold you down. You have summer, and you are going to do something great. You just need to give time to the thing that you are going to do which will be great. So whenever you are taking tests and what not stop getting distracted. It sucksand Michael Yan is a snake. For some reason, it's just kind of toxic the way he treats you. YES TREATS YOU. You are affected by the way someone treats you, so let it go. He is just a guy. Don't let him affect you and his cancerous shitty ways. Ok relax and think about your plans. First get by AP exams, and then full throttle, lets get this resume game on point. Your goals and his are very different. You know years from now Swagat and Michael Yan won't even be in your league. You want to change the world. They want to do some menial labor kind of job. Stanford, Harvard whatever. Just focus and don't let this affect you.

**I'm Being a Silly Goose**

So I'm considering when I should ask Reina out since some guy already asked her out that goes to her school. I know for sure how I am going to do it. So I'm thinking I'll just do it tomorrow because you know what I really don't care right. So yea I'll do it tomorrow. Perfect I'm done. Good job!

# 2016-09-03

**Finally Done**

Finally called it off with Reina and felt great at first. Something is weighing down but as I look at the long list of my goals I become more determined that this isn't important and this was just a distraction that was enjoyed. Now it is time to focus and do what I was meant to do, solidly and with perfection!

**Related Focus**

You are falling behind. People are working harder than you and are changing the world. The very and only thing you want to do. I don't understand why you are caught up on Reina. Gain clarity and focus on moving forward. Take whatever you have and gain more. Things like Science Bowl and these AP exams should be easy. Google Science Fair, ISEF, RSI is something that you'll do not because you want to, but you have to. SO focus on what you are doing and don't let your mind divert. Understand that it is her fault that she is missing out on the most interesting person on this planet. Your related memories of taking her to the movies or how Professor Butler (MARSHALL GSE CAMP) told you about going to Prom out of your mind. You have more important goals, and as you type this you are gaining more and more clarity. Ok nice. Now close this tab and run it down like fire going through gasoline!!

# 2016-08-19

**Vent**

You have so much to do!! Stop focus on Reina!! She is probably busy or doesn't want to talk for some reason. You have a lot of goals and don't get distracted by all of this. That is why a "relationship" wasn't meant for you. Just wait for her to reply back. Hopefully it is soon if it's not whatever! Maybe it is something that she is doing. So focus! OK good. Lets see what happens. If this isn't working just break it off, but there definitely is some reason so just flow with it. Good job. Proud of you.

# 2016-08-14

**That's what I Do - Keep Low Expectations**

Haven't had a full fledged legit conversation with Reina in four days which is annoying the heck out of me. So I came here to vent out.She told me she would be free but she didn't message me back. Now that I think about it, she probably has some reason. She is with her uncle. I know its not justifiable. A hi or some sort of text would've been good, but I guess I'm not in her psych. I was the last one to message and by the tone of it, she was the one that was supposed to message back, but lets see what happens. I need to keep an open mind about it, and I will wait for her to message back. Something could've happened to her... probability. Well we'll see. I might message her asking if everything is fine, but I need to be mature and uptight about this. Hmm... nice feels good after writing about this. Now I can focus on more important things. She better have a good excuse but toodles.

**Memories Relapsing from WVGSE**

There is a lot of memories I'm fond of that keep coming back and pestering me. Hugging Reina and interacting with her being one of them. Strip pong with Sahil, Theo, and Grant remain prominent. I also remember how I never did the elevator thing which I was glad because to be fair it definitely would've been something. The lessons I learned which I hopefully can implement. I'm currently trying to startup CustomSent so lets see how that goes. I need to learn to be more efficient with my time.

**Dreams - Dream Diary 01**

I just have a realization that I never do anything myself, that is why I never kept up with writing in this diary. I had a very vivid dream last night and it was one of those where I wished it was real.

It was some sort of rave. Reina was there and upon seeing her I went and embraced her with all might. She was taller than me due to her heals. It was a semi-lucid dream for instead of going for a lip-to-lip i purposely steered and went for her left cheek. This is where it gets a bit weird. I was there for quite a while and almost in a very good and hazed moved remained. I was almost on and off asleep yet awake. Later she left without any reason. I obviously didn't follow. Later the scene shifted into some sort of auditorium. I saw Allison Groves, and I know why. It's because she has a somewhat changed personality social media wise, but then after a bit Reina came and sat beside me. We talked about why she left. And I remember controlling this situation somewhat the way I would do in real life, in a joking way. The choice of words that I used were "love of my life" but i remember thinking that this relationship is just sort of there.

I need to focus and make sure I don't face any distractions, though she is very nice but we are getting there in our closeness. I have goals but these days I seem very dazed. Looking at my list I have lot that hasn't been accomplished so here I come.

# 2015-11-14

**Aftermath** 

So after the semi - not really date, I was walking her down from the library, and or conversation steered towards our license and of course age. She might've misunderstood me when I told her about how I was more or less a year younger than her. Later two days from that, she was being kind of mean to me in Health. This did sadden me a bit to be honest. I thought we were having quite a good conversation, but then it might've been because she knows that I'm a year younger than her or maybe she was simply feeling a bit off that day. That probably might be it. I did text her though afterwards the semi - not really date, but she didn't reply which I guess I fine. If i look at that fact positively, she didn't see the text or I guess she didn't want to. I need to start focusing on more important things like the coding competitions and stuff, but she is always constantly on my thought. Why can't I get her out?? Evolution vs. Willpower is so done. The only way I can know anymore about this is let time pass, and see what happens. Maybe she asks me out, but I guess I played my card, and now everything is up to her. Hopefully writing this helps me lessen her thought in my mind, but lets see. Cheers to the future and good luck to me.

**Still**

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/cda48940-4208-4e15-a97d-31071b66766a/Untitled.png)

As you see I sorta did it. I'm curious to see how this turns out in the future. I do really like her, but we know why this will most likely not work out in the long run. First time I actually ever did this, and considering I put a lot of thought into this, it most likely is the right decision, but then again there was a huge impact from my emotions. It's just that however much I want to not like her seeing her or just picturizing her brings the feelings back, so it's something that I have seem to kept in terms with. Hopefully I look back and cherish on this because she is truly pretty cool, and it's is a surprise how we don't have a whole bunch in common, but it is our personality that keeps us intact. Another positive bonus of this is that I have started writing in my diary, and hopefully I continue. My writing needs to stay intact for my future, and this is one way that'll help. The blog is running kinda low. I'm planning to complete Outliers: The Story of Success and write a review about that. Book is a true eye-opener. Well for now I have quite a bit of AP Physics 1 and Chem to do, so kudos for.

**Ugh Obsession (p2)**

New day and titled it the same as yesterdays is because I didn't complete it. I want to talk about this. I want to ask her out, maybe to a movie. I'm planning to indirectly ask her what a potential good first date idea would be.http://thoughtcatalog.com/mike-zacchio/2015/04/5-reasons-why-the-movies-are-a-great-first-date/  It's her presence that makes me really happy and this link makes sense. Apparently collecting movie tickets is quite solid. Venting this out here is actually not too shabby. Someday, I'm quite certain, that I'll look back on this and say how stupid I was but maybe not. Maybe I'll understand the power of how evolution can withstand willpower. I guess for now I have some Calculus homework to complete.

The thing is Madalyn Sparks. I know now why I like her, and I know this is a distraction. I know the potential devastities of starting a relationship knowing well that it won't continue till the end. We are quite different but I still like her -a lot. Ever since homecoming where - thanks to her sister, where she somewhat forced me to go - the thing that I had for her rekindled.

I think she does like me. Why would otherwise someone go to homecoming, but I feel she could be talking more to me. Every other day I have a class with her and I greatly look forward to it just to have a short conversation. I need to refocus my energy into more productive things. I have understood though that thousands of years of evolution can definitely surpass my willpower, and I'm on the verge of it. I used to be so much more "independent" when she wouldn't constantly pop up in my mind, and its going on for a while.

The reason why I love her is because of her personality. Thats it and of.course the slight physical attraction. We don't have a strong ground for common things we like. She is really fun loving and chill and I wish I could just go up to her and ask her for a movie date or something, but being born into this family doesn't help the situation.

At times I think the culture is.forcing me, but then I realized that the main culture doesn't really think about the consequences of being in a relationship, and regardless looking at my cousins I see that's its definitely more or less the same. So what should I do? My heart aches go call out to her, and if she truly likes - dare I say love-  it might be a serious relationship which has a very low likelihood of continuing till "the depths of time."

But sometimes I think why can't it? Why can't two people.approaching two different fields be together? Can't a white and a brown person have their shot at their love story? I'm not sure about the lengths at which my.family could tolerate this. First a love and not the default arranged marriage and second not to even an Indian. And again should u just do this for fun? No intent of living with her for the rest of my.life? See that wouldn't be being open and I feel.that is very important for a successful romantic relationship. Or maybe I do but I'm not sure if.I'm satisfied with her intellectual/academic value.

**Wussup**

After I lost my journal about 2 1/2 years ago, I didn't feel like writing back, but now I've decided that my mind has become too distracted, and I can still get up and do something about it. It has been a while, but I can still write memories. Baba passed away on July 17th leaving me befuddled. I have started losing myself to this world once again. With such a distracted mind and huge goals I don't know what to do. Tenth grade starts tomorrow and I'm feeling a bit dismissed. I have not been able to complete my online Pre-Calc course and due to that can't take AP Calc AB as I wanted to. The one month trip to India was partially responsible, but if I was a bit more stubborn I might've been able to complete it, but oh well. What can I do now? I don't know what my goals are. For the past few days I felt so icky. I have realized that my ambitions are what fuels me, but here I am sitting and watching Bollywood movies and YouTube videos. I want to start a company, get on the Science Bowl team, do AMC make AIME, but for that hard work is required, apparently something that I'm not able to give. I fell in the teenage pothole of finding a significant other but realized how pointless it is. No one here is compatible with me, and it is an unbelievable waste of time thinking about it. I want to do so many things right now, like make a rap, write some blogs, read Outliers The Story of Success, do something. I don't know!! I want to be awesome, make something out of myself, but I get so distracted! YouTube, Netflix, movies, episodes everything! I need to focus and I guess after writing this done i feel a lot better. Till next time, kudos.
